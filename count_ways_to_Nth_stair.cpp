/*There are n stairs, and a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top (order does not matter).
Input:
n = 4
Output: 
3
Explanation: 
You can reach 4th stair in 3 ways.
3 possible ways are:
1, 1, 1, 1
1, 1, 2
2, 2
Here, note that {1, 1, 2}, {1, 2, 1} and {2, 1, 1} are considered same as their order does not matter. */
